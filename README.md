Understanding "Test-driven development". It is very excited to learn this because I often feel doing it by "refresh click click click..." Its unproductive, takes to long and lots of loop wholes doing clicky way.


## What will I learn?

You will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
